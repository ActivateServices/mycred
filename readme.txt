== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does myCRED support Multisite Installations? =

Yes, **my**CRED supports Multisite installations.

= Can my "Points" use decimals? =

Yes. When you run the **my**CRED Setup, you will be asked if you want to use whole numbers or decimals. However it should be noted that once the setup is completed, this can not be changed without first deleting **my**CRED though the 'Delete Plugin' function in WordPress (in other words, DO NOT delete the files using FTP).

= I want to charge a user for creating a group, can I disable group creation for users who does not have enough points? =

Yes. You can set a negative value for either "Creating Group" or "Joining Group" which will restrict a user from creating or joining any group unless they have enough points without going minus on their account.

= Some Hooks contain several instances where points might be given to users. Can I disable parts of them or do I have to use every instance? =

You can always disable parts of a hook by awarding zero points. Hooks that have zero points are ignored.

= Can I use the mycred_sell_this shortcode multiple times in a post?

Yes but if one of them is bought, all is shown. The mycred_sell_this shortcode was created so you can show "teaser" content before someone purchases the post / page / custom post type. It was not built to sell multiple items on a single page.
