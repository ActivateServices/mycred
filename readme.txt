myCRED is an adaptive points management system that lets you award / charge your users for interacting with your WordPress powered website.

== Description ==

** Important! myCRED 1.5 requires WordPress 3.8 or higher! Websites using WordPress 3.5 or higher would need to use version 1.4.7. **

** Premium buyCRED Gateway users must disable their premium gateways before updating myCRED! Please update to the latest version before enabling them again! **

I felt that todays WordPress community lacks a flexible points management system. Existing system often feel restrictive, stale or lack support for popular plugins.

So I built an adaptive plugin which gives itâ€™s users full control on how points are awarded, used, traded, managed, logged and presented. Built on the "opt-in" principle, it is up to you what features you want to use and how. If your WordPress installation does not support a feature it is hidden from you to keep things clean and simple.

**my**CRED comes packed with features along with built-in support for some of the most popular [WordPress plugins](http://mycred.me/about/supported-plugins/) out there. But of course **my**CRED does not support everything out of the box so I have documented as much as possible in the **my**CRED [codex](http://codex.mycred.me) and you can find several [tutorials](http://mycred.me/support/tutorials/) that can help you better acquaint yourself with **my**CRED.

I am here to help where ever I can but please remember that right now this is a one man show and I do need an occasional coffee break.

You are welcome to post your issues or questions under the "Support" tab but remember that  **my**CRED has it's own [online forum](http://mycred.me/support/forums/) along with [F.A.Q.](http://mycred.me/about/faq/) page and an online [support page](http://mycred.me/support/).

**About Hooks**

**my**CRED hooks are instances where you award or deduct points from a user. By default you can award point for: registrations, logins, content publishing, commenting, clicking on links and viewing YouTube videos. You can find more information on built-in hooks [here](http://mycred.me/about/hooks/).


**About Add-ons**

**my**CRED add-ons allows you to enable more complex features that is not just about awarding / deducting points. Features include: [Sell Content](http://mycred.me/add-ons/sell-content/) with points, [Buy points](http://mycred.me/add-ons/buycred/) for real money, [Transfer](http://mycred.me/add-ons/transfer/) points between users, award [ranks](http://mycred.me/add-ons/ranks/) according to points balances. You can find a complete list of [built-in](http://mycred.me/add-on-types/built-in/) and [premium](http://mycred.me/add-on-types/premium/) add-ons [here](http://mycred.me/add-ons/).
